## Q14.Write a function to check if a number is prime or not.
## A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 
## and that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

# def prime(number):
#     i=1
#     count=0
#     while i<=number:
#         if number%i==0:
#             count+=1
#         i+=1
#     if count==2:
#         print(number,"prime number")
#     else:
#         print(number,"not prime number")
# number=int(input("enter number:"))
# prime(number)
